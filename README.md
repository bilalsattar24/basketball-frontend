#Bilal's RBY Coding Challenge

I had a lot of fun writing this little Vue application and integrating it with a supbase backend.

It's been a bit of time since I last used Vue, so it took me some time to ramp up before I was able to get up to full speed ahead. None the less, I believe this project does a solid job at showcasing my abilities when it comes to full stack web development. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it!

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

Then Navigate to localhost:3000

You will see a link to view teams and players on the home page.

I added the ability to edit a player's name. That edit can be triggered by simply clicking the name of the team. This will show a form to edit the player's name.

The data is actually stored in a supabase database. I decided to use a cloud deployed version of the supabase backend so that it would be easy for you run the project without having to set up a local database and seeding the data. The credentials for the database are hard coded in the code base.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I am happy to help in any way I can. I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
